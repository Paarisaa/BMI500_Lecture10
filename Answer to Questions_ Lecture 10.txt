1- How many 1-1 mappings are there?

Number of 1-1 mappings in 9->10 GEMs: 22100
Number of 1-1 mappings in 10->9 GEMs: 71829

2- How many 1-many mappings are there? In general, is the concept on the 1 side equivalent to the concepts on the many side? Explain.

Number of 1-many mappings in 9->10 GEMs: 2338
Number of 1-many mappings in 10->9 GEMs: 9033

Yes, the general concept of 1 side is equivalent the concepts of many side, but the many side has more specificity and more information about the codes.


3-How many terms have no mappings?

Number of no mappings in 9->10 GEMs: 422
Number of no mappings in 10->9 GEMs: 731

4-Given the goal of resolving all 1:many mappings down to 1:1 mappings, which mapping direction (10->9 or 9->10) is more
feasible? Explain your answer.

I guess resolving the mappings from 9->10 direction is more feasible, because the there is more information on ICD10 codes and they are more specefic.
Also, the number of ICD10 codes are much more than the ICD9 codes and we have to be able to map the codes from ICD9 to ICD10.
