# BMI500 Homework (Lecture10)

ICDMAPPINGS.py is python 3.6 program to find the number of 1-1, 1-many mappings and also no mappings in both 10->9 GEMs (ICD10 to 9) and the 9->10 GEMs(ICD9 to 10).

To run the code, run the following command:
```python ICDMAPPINGS.py path1 path2```

Where path1 is the path1 to '2018_I9gem.txt' file and path2 is the path to '2018_I10gem.txt' file. For instance, if the '2018_I9gem.txt' file is in the same folder as the python code. the path1 is : './2018_I9gem.txt' and you need to run the following command:
```python ICDMAPPINGS.py ./2018_I9gem.txt ./2018_I10gem.txt```
